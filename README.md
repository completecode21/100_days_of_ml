# 100 Days of ML

100 Days of Machine Learning Machine Learning (ML) is at the core of Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and many other fields. To master these areas, it is essential to learn ML in a sophisticated manner. To prioritize this, I have embarked on a Machine Learning journey by completing the [100 Days of Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH) YouTube playlist by Nitish Singh on his YouTube channel [@CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/@campusx-official).


Following Nitish sir ML playlist, I have understood the actual ML fundamentals. He has posted 130+ videos in his playlist, with all the notes available on his [website](learnwith.campusx.in), and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/campusx-official) He has also done a lot of work in the AIML and DS fields, which you can check out.




## Topics Covered:

- Data Gathering
- Data Exploration
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Feature Engineering

## Notes

I have also added my handwritten notes, which I wrote while attending the "100 Days of Machine Learning" playlist. Refer to these notes if you are following Nitish Sir and @CampusX for ML. These notes follow the sequence of his YouTube playlist.

Thank you!
