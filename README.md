100 Days of Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is at the core of Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and many other fields. To master these areas, 
it is essential to learn ML in a sophisticated manner. To prioritize this, I have embarked on a Machine Learning journey by completing the "100 Days of Machine Learning" 
YouTube playlist by Nitish Singh on his YouTube channel @CampusX.

Following his ML playlist, I have understood the actual ML fundamentals. He has posted 130+ videos in his playlist, with all the notes available on his 
website - learnwith.campusx.in, and the code is available on GitHub - https://github.com/campusx-official. He has also done a lot of work in the AIML and DS fields, 
which you can check out.


About This Repository
This repository contains all the ML code I performed while completing the "100 Days of Machine Learning" course. The structure and content are quite similar to 
Nitish Sir's repository because I have referred to his repo - https://github.com/campusx-official/100-days-of-machine-learning. However, in the upcoming days, 
I will surely be adding new code content to it. You can directly fork this repository for your convenience while following the ML playlist by @CampusX.

Topics Covered in the Repo:
Data Gathering
Data Exploration
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Feature Engineering
Regression Algorithms
Gradient Regression Algorithms
Regularization
Accuracy and Confusion Matrix
Decision Trees
Ensemble Learning
Clustering
SVM (Support Vector Machines)
Naive Bayes Classifier
Imbalanced Data Handling
Notes
I have also added my handwritten notes, which I wrote while attending the "100 Days of Machine Learning" playlist. 
Refer to these notes if you are following Nitish Sir and @CampusX for ML. These notes follow the sequence of his YouTube playlist.

Thank you!
